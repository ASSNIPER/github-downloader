# Download file/folder For GitHub. Chrome Extension

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onlylemi/res/master/download-any-for-github-icon.png)

It's a chrome extension. When we look up some resources in `GitHub`, and usually we need to look them in local. At this time we must use `git clone`, `Download ZIP` or `Open in Desktop`. But sometimes we don't need to download the whole repository and only to look some folders or some files. So this chrome extension can help you achieve your demand.

It can download any files or folders from repository in GitHub.

## Preview

Let we look named [butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) repository from [JakeWharton](https://github.com/JakeWharton).

## Install

### Method 1

Download [`download-any-for-github.crx`](https://github.com/onlylemi/download-any-for-github/releases) file and drop `Chrome Extension` to install. 

### Method 2

If method 1 doesn't work. Download this repository and unzip it, then load the folder(click `load upacked extension`) in `Chrome Extension`(on developer mode).
