![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onlylemi/res/master/download-any-for-github-icon.png)

It's a chrome extension. When we look up some resources in `GitHub`, and usually we need to look them in local. At this time we must use `git clone`, `Download ZIP` or `Open in Desktop`. But soemtimes we don't need to download the whole repository and only to look some floders or some files. So this chrome extension can help you achieve your demand.

It can download any files or floders from repository in github.

## Preview

Let we look named [butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) repository from [JakeWharton](https://github.com/JakeWharton).
